      Hey there!
  </h1> 
  <p>
    You appear to have landed on my website.
    <br>
    My name is Nicolò Ruggeri, I am a <b>Machine Learning Scientist</b> with an interest for generative modelling and applications in biology.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Previously, I obtained a Ph.D. within the <a href="https://learning-systems.org/" target="_blank">Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems</a>, in between MPI for Intelligent Systems (Tübingen) and ETH (Zürich).
    <br>
    There, I was co-supervised by 
    <a href="https://www.cdebacco.com/" target="_blank">Caterina De Bacco</a> and
    <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/" target="_blank">Fanny Yang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research revolves around probabilistic methods in machine learning and their applications. Lately, I have also been tackling complex problems in biology with a variety of these tools.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some keywords that might or might not make sense include:
    <ul>
      <li>Generative modelling
        <ul>
          <li>Diffusion methods & affine</li>
          <li>Protein design</li>
          <li>Foundational models for omics</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Variational inference
        <ul>
          <li>Ranking on networks</li>
          <li>Variational autoencoders</li>
          <li>Interpretability and disentanglement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Graphs
        <ul>
          <li>Modelling of network-type data</li>
          <li>Community detection</li>
          <li>Message passing, EM-inference and general probabilistic inference</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>
  Broadly speaking, I am interested in both theory and applications, as well as any topic related to the above. <br>
  I also have a keen interest in clean and efficient code. <br>
  So feel free to get in touch!
