      Hey there!
  </h1> 
  <p>You appear to have landed in my website.</p> 
  <p>
    My name is Nicol√≤ Ruggeri, I am PhD student at the <a href="https://learning-systems.org/">Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems</a>.
    <br>
    I am co-supervised by 
    <a href="https://www.cdebacco.com/">Caterina De Bacco</a> and
    <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/">Fanny Yang</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, my research revolves around probabilistic methods in machine learning and their applications. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some keywords that might or might not make sense include:
    <ul>
      <li>Variational inference
        <ul>
          <li>Ranking on networks</li>
          <li>Variational autoencoders</li>
          <li>Interpretability and disentanglement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Network science
        <ul>
          <li>Modelling of network-type data</li>
          <li>Community detection</li>
          <li>Message passing, EM-inference and general probabilistic inference</li>
        </ul>
  </ul>
  Broadly speaking, I am interested in both theory and applications, as well as any topic related to the above. <br>
  So feel free to get in touch!
